# Project Summary

This project shows deep understanding of cv2 (opencv), image/data processing techniques, and graphical analysis.

Part of a larger research project, for the Oyster Foundation

The comparison of the 3 pairs of graphs, which represent the average RGB values of the experimental (left)
and control (right)tubs, demonstrates a noticeable impact of the oysters' filtration on the water quality
within an hour. In the provided code, images are first loaded and processed from a specified directory.
Then, the average color values of designated regions within the experimental and control groups are
calculated. These regions correspond to the areas where the oysters are located.
